  ==============================================================================
    add a chassis behaviour mode
    1. in chassis_behaviour.h , add a new behaviour name in chassis_behaviour
    erum
    {  
        ...
        ...
        CHASSIS_XXX_XXX, // new add
    }chassis_behaviour_e,
    2. implement new function. chassis_xxx_xxx_control(fp32 *vx, fp32 *vy, fp32 *wz, chassis_move_t * chassis )
        "vx, vy, wz" param is chassis movement control input. 
        first param: 'vx' usually means  vertical speed,
            positive value means forward speed, negative value means backward speed.
        second param: 'vy' usually means horizotal speed,
            positive value means letf speed, negative value means right speed
        third param: 'wz' can be rotation speed set or angle set, 

        in this new function, you can assign speed to "vx","vy",and "wz",as your wish
    3.  in "chassis_behaviour_mode_set" function, add new logical judgement to assign CHASSIS_XXX_XXX to  "chassis_behaviour_mode" variable,
        and in the last of the function, add "else if(chassis_behaviour_mode == CHASSIS_XXX_XXX)" 
        choose a chassis control mode.
        four mode:
        CHASSIS_VECTOR_FOLLOW_GIMBAL_YAW : 'vx' and 'vy' are speed control, 'wz' is angle set to control relative angle
            between chassis and gimbal. you can name third param to 'xxx_angle_set' other than 'wz'
        CHASSIS_VECTOR_FOLLOW_CHASSIS_YAW : 'vx' and 'vy' are speed control, 'wz' is angle set to control absolute angle calculated by gyro
            you can name third param to 'xxx_angle_set.
        CHASSIS_VECTOR_NO_FOLLOW_YAW : 'vx' and 'vy' are speed control, 'wz' is rotation speed control.
        CHASSIS_VECTOR_RAW : will use 'vx' 'vy' and 'wz'  to linearly calculate four wheel current set, 
            current set will be derectly sent to can bus.
    4. in the last of "chassis_behaviour_control_set" function, add
        else if(chassis_behaviour_mode == CHASSIS_XXX_XXX)
        {
            chassis_xxx_xxx_control(vx_set, vy_set, angle_set, chassis_move_rc_to_vector);
        }
